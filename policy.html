        <li><strong>Expense List:</strong> Enables you to record and manage expenses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Manage Your Information</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect any personal data, we don't use or share your information with anyone. All lists created within the app are stored locally on your device and remain private to you.</p>

    <p>Your data security is our priority. Lists and data created within the Everyday app are stored locally on your device. We do not utilize cloud storage or external servers, ensuring your information stays with you.</p>

    <h2>4. Suitable for All Ages</h2>
